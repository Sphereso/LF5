This repository is a product of Mika Bomm, Conner Bogen, Yunus Albayrak for the learning field 5. <br>
The goal of learning field 5 is to model a database, based on customers requirements. <br>
We use postgreSQL as a database, pgAdmin for an admin dashboard to the database and a migration tool so we can always get the same initial setup.
